    <h2>Microsoft Word Components</h2>
    <p>Before you get started with Microsoft Word (commonly referred to as MS Word), you will need to locate and open it from the computer.</p>
    <p><br/>It may be on your desktop.
    
    From the computer desktop:<br/>
    Double-click on the <b>MS Word icon </b><br/>
        or<br/>
    Go to the Start menu if the MS Word icon is not on the desktop <br/>or in task bar: <br/>
    Click <code><b>Start</b></code> -> <code><b>Programs</b></code> -> <code><b>Microsoft Word</b></code> </p>

    <h3>Title Bar</h3>
    <p>This display the title of the application running in the window, and the title of the working document.</p> 
    <i>Notice the three buttons on the right side, controlling program features. Remember that the <code>X</code> button 
    on the far right means close the program, the middle button is a toggle switch between full screen and a small window, and the single line button on the left means minimize to the task bar. </i>
    
    <h3>The Menu Bar</h3>
    <p>
        The Menu Bar is a common sight in almost all Microsoft Windows programs. It features text-based menus, on which are listed virtually every option. Each menu expands when clicked (with the left mouse button), offering many options categorized by specific tasks. This menu is also customizable 
        to offer a more personalized experience for the user.
    </p> 
    
    <p>You can click on each of the words to see a menu of the tasks you can perform.</p>
    
    To see a menu: 
    <ol>
    <li>Point with your mouse to a menu option.</li>
    <li>Click the left mouse button once to open list of commands in the toolbar.</li>
    <li>Point with your mouse to a particular item</li>
    <li>Click once with the left mouse button to select the item</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Toolbar</h3>
    <p>
        They appear in many programs and provide quick ways to do tasks. Most toolbar buttons 
        corresponds to a menu command.
        The function of each button can be shown by resting the mouse pointer over the button; a box, 
        known as a tooltip, appears, displaying the name of the button.
    </p>

    <h3>The Ruler</h3>  
    <p>
        The ruler is generally found below the main toolbars. The ruler tells you where you are on the page, 
        along with the dimensions of the overall document. Just like a real-world piece of paper, the default 
        setting is <code>8.5 x 11 inches</code>, and margins have been incorporated for you. Similar to most options in 
        MS Word, this is entirely customizable and the user can create documents of any dimension.

    <h3>Scroll Bar</h3>
    <p>
        Some windows and dialog box have several scroll bars that can be used to view text that cannot fit into the window. The scroll bar is a narrow strip located along the right or bottom border of the window with a small box for scrolling. A window may have both vertical and horizontal scroll bars as required. To scroll information displayed in the appropriate scroll box is dragged in the desired 
        direction.
    </p>

    <h3>Status Bar</h3>
    <p>
        This is normally the last line at the bottom of every window; it displays information about the 
        active document such as number of pages, current page, current position of a cursor, number of 
        character in the document, zooming slide and so on.
