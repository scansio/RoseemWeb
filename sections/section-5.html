    <h1>AutoSummarize</h1>
    <p>
        Available in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or 
        phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an 
        executive summary. The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a 
        percentage of the current amount of text.
        According to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by 
        counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in 
        the document (barring "a" and "the" and the like) and assigns a "score" to each word � the more 
        frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it "averages" each sentence by adding the 
        scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence � the higher the 
        average, the higher the rank of the sentence. "It's like the ratio of wheat to chaff," explains Fein.[92]
        AutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in 
        Word for Mac 2008. AutoSummarize was removed from the Office 2010 release version (14) as 
        well.
