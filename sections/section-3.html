						<h1>TEMPLATE</h1>
						<p>
							Several later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, 
							allowing them to define a file in which the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ 
							from the standard Word templates. Users can find how to do this under the Help section located 
							near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).
							For example, Normal.dot is the master template from which all Word documents are created. It 
							determines the margin defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although 
							normal.dot is already set with certain defaults, the user can change normal.dot to new defaults. This 
							will change other documents which were created using the template, usually in unexpected ways.
							Image formats
						</p>
						<p>
							Word can import and display images in common bitmap formats such as JPG and GIF. It can also 
							be used to create and display simple line-art. Microsoft Word added support[82] for the 
							common SVG vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality 
							was also included in the Office 2019 release.
