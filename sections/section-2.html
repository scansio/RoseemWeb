<section id="section-2" class="formatting">
						<h1>Formatting</h1>
						<p>Changing the look of what you've written is called <b>formatting</b>. This can include 
						changing the text style, size, color, and more.</p>
						<p>You can also make bold, underline, or italicize when using MS Word. These features do not have to be used independently of each other either, in other words, you can make bold, 
						underline, and italicize a single piece of text.</p>
						<p>To make text really stand out, you can also combine this with alignment and size to produce 
						a heading in bold, italics, underlined, sized and centered.
						</p>
						<p>In order to apply certain stylistic or other changes to text, you must first highlight the text. 
						This is a common procedure in Microsoft Windows applications, and like being able to successfully 
						navigate the mouse around your screen, the ability to highlight well is one that you want to master. 
						To highlight text, you start by placing your cursor (by moving the mouse) directly to one side of the 
						selection that you are working with.</p>
						<p>Then, drag the mouse across the sentence, and a black highlight will follow. The computer now understands that any and all formatting that you command will ONLY apply to the part of the sentence that you highlighted (and not �to show,� since it is not highlighted).
						
						<h3>Deleting Text</h3>
						<p>While typing a document, you may make a mistake. Unlike a typewriter, MS Word can delete 
						text on the screen that leaves no residue, it is as if you never typed on the page in the first place.</p>
						<p>A common source of confusion for users is understanding the difference between the <b><code>Delete</code></b> key and the <b><code>Backspace</code></b> key.</p>
			
						Put simply, the 
						<code><b>Backspace</b></code> key deletes words to the <b>LEFT</b> of the cursor, and the <code><b>Delete</b></code> key deletes words to the 
						<b>RIGHT</b> of the cursor.
			
						<h3>Undo and Redo </h3>
						<p>The UNDO and REDO features of Microsoft Windows applications are great tools to rely on 
						(especially in MS Word). The program will keep a list of the last 25 commands that you have 
						performed, and it will allow for taking �one step� backwards in order to erase what you have just 
						done. </p>
						<ol>
						It is a common thought that life itself should have an UNDO feature.
						<li>Click Edit ?Undo from the Menu Bar to go back one step (up to 25)</li> 
						<li>Click <code>Edit</code> -> <code class="">Redo</code> from the <b>Menu Bar</b> to go forward one step (up to 25</li> 	
						<li>Copying, Cutting, and Pasting Text</li> 
						</ol>
						<p>In MS Word, you can CUT or COPY text from one area of the document and save that text so it can be PASTED elsewhere in the document. When you CUT text, you actually delete it from where you took it, as opposed to COPYING it, which makes, naturally, a carbon copy of your selection. (CUTTING a  selection will also make a copy of it, just in case you want to PASTE it elsewhere.) 
						When you CUT or COPY text, it is stored on what is known as the CLIPBOARD.  The Clipboard 
						is a tool in MS Word that you can use to stash away cuts and copies of your work, to be in pasted 
						in other places in the document. Once your selection is on the CLIPBOARD, you can PASTE it as 
						many times as you want! 
						To CUT a selection, first highlight it. Then, click ?Edit ?Cut from the Menu Bar. The 
						highlighted text will disappear, as you have just cut it out (but a copy is now on your clipboard) 
						and MS Word is waiting for you to paste it somewhere else. 
						To PASTE this cut selection somewhere else on the page, place your cursor where you want the 
						selection to go. Click ?Edit ?Paste from the menu bar, and it will pop into place, right where your 
						cursor is. 
						To COPY, simply follow those same steps, replacing the CUT command with COPY. You will 
						notice immediately that the COPY command will not alter your original selection at all, as it is 
						simply making a copy of it.</p>
						<quote>***Always remember to highlight the selection! MS Word will not 
						allow you to CUT, COPY or PASTE unless you have 
						highlighted something first!*** </quote>
			
						<h3>Spelling and Grammar Check</h3> 
						<p>One of the benefits of using a computerized word processor is that of its ability to recognize, change 
						and give advice about what you are writing. MS Word has utilities that can check your spelling and 
						grammar against a master database, and can offer advice on a variety of different grammatical 
						styles. </p>
						<p>MS Word automatically underlines any words that it does not recognize in red, assuming that they 
						are not spelled right, and green if it does not recognize the grammar, assuming that the sentence 
						does not make logical sense.</p> For example: 
			
						<h3>Printing Documents</h3> 
						<p>To print your MS Word document: 
						Click <b><code>File</code></b> -> <b><code>Print</code></b> from the <b>Menu Bar</b> and a <b>Print window</b> will pop up on the screen.</p>
						Click <b><code>OK</code></b> for your document to start printing. 
						
						<p>As with all commands in MS Word, you can make changes along the way. From the 
						<b>Print menu</b>, you can alter how many copies will be made, in what order the pages will be 
						and much more. 
						Another useful tool is the <code>Print Preview</code> function found alongside the Print command.<br/>
						This will allow you to look over an exact copy of what will come out of the printer before 
						actually executing the print command. It is especially useful when experimenting with 
						altered margins and page dimensions, and can help to conserve paper.
			
						<h3>Saving Documents</h3> 
							<p>
								When you finish typing and want to leave the computer, it is important to save your work 
								(even if you are printing a hard copy, saving should be a reflex). To save your work in MS 
								There are many places in which you can save a file, some of which are portable and some of which 
								are immobile.
							</p>
							<p>
								The My Documents folder on your computer�s hard drive is a good place to store your 
								documents. A blank CD (compact disc) is a great portable storage device and can contain a LOT of 
								data.
							</p>  
							<p>
								It is important to note that every consequent command of SAVE will overwrite your original 
								file, creating the most up-to-date version.  
								If you want to save the changed document without destroying the original one: In the Menu 
								Bar, click ?File ?Save As from the menu bar and give your document a new filename 
								(unique from the original). 
							</p>
							
							To bring a saved document back up on the screen from MS Word: Click	<code>File</code> -> <code>Open</code> from the <b>Menu Bar</b>.<br/>
							
							Locate where the file is located (which folder, that is) and click on the filename of the document you 
							want. <br/>
							Click <code>Open</code>. <br/>
							
						<h3>Closing Microsoft Word</h3> 
						<p>When you are finished </p>
						Click <code>File</code> -> <code>Exit</code> from the <b>menu bar </b><br/>
						OR 
						Click on the <code><b>X</b></code> in the top right corner of the computer screen. 
						<p>
							As you become more and more comfortable with the program, it is always helpful to continue to 
							experiment with options that you come across sometimes, you can uncover a tool that would 
							have stayed hidden, and you can improve proficiency by learning the fine details of the 
							program.

						<h3>Layout issues</h3>
	<p>
		Before Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly 
		handle ligatures defined in OpenType fonts.[83] Those ligature glyphs with Unicode codepoints may 
		be inserted manually, but are not recognized by Word for what they are, breaking spell checking, 
		while custom ligatures present in the font are not accessible at all. Since Word 2010, the program 
		now has advanced typesetting features which can be enabled:[84] OpenType ligatures,[85] kerning, 
		and hyphenation (previous versions already had the latter two features). Other layout deficiencies of 
		Word include the inability to set crop marks or thin spaces. Various third-party workaround utilities 
		have been developed.[86]
		In Word 2004 for Mac OS X, support of complex scripts was inferior even to Word 97,[87] and Word 
		2004 did not support Apple Advanced Typography features like ligatures or glyph variants.

	<h3>Bullets and numbering</h3>
	<p class="p">
		Microsoft Word supports bullet lists and numbered lists. It also features a numbering system that 
		helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; 
		these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are 
		deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to 
		lists.[89] Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In 
		particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead 
		resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that 
		said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart 
		Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to cut the first item of the 
		listed and paste it as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and 
		the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.[90]
		Users can also create tables in Word. Depending on the version, Word can perform simple 
		calculations, along with support for formulas and equations as well.

		<h3>WordArt </h3>
		<p class="p">
			An example image created with WordArt
			WordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, 
			with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and 
			colors and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as 
			shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. 
			Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects, and add text effects to paragraph styles.
