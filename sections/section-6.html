    <h1>Password protection</h1>
    <p>
        There are three password types that can be set in Microsoft Word:
        <ol>
            <li>Password to open a document</li>
            <li>Password to modify a document</li>
            <li>Password restricting formatting and editing</li>
        </ol>
        The second and the third type of passwords were developed by Microsoft for convenient shared use 
        of documents rather than for their protection. There is no encryption of documents that are protected 
        by such passwords, and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a hash sum of a password in a 
        document's header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized 
        software. Password to open a document offers much tougher protection that had been steadily 
        enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.
        Word 95 and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a 
        password to a 16-bit key.

        Key length in Word 97 and 2000 was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software 
        allows removing such a password very quickly ï¿½ a persistent cracking process takes one week at 
        most. Use of rainbow tables reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some password 
        recovery software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used 
        by a user to encrypt the document using brute-force attack approach. Statistically, the possibility of 
        recovering the password depends on the password strength.

        Word's 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced 
        users choosing a Cryptographic Service Provider was added. If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed 
        document decryption becomes unavailable, and therefore a password can't be removed from the 
        document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because 
        its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by 
        default, their use is limited to advanced users only.
    </p>
    <p>
        Word 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern Advanced 
        Encryption Standard (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a SHA-1 hash function 
        50000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key 
        in a reasonable amount of time exists), and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to 
        several hundreds of passwords per second.
    </p>
    <p>
        Word's 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 
        conversions up to 100000 times, and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two 
        times more.
