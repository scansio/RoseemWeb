						<h1>Macros</h1>
						<p>
							A Macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of 
							characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently 
							used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated. Like 
							other Microsoft Office documents, Word files can include advanced macros and even embedded 
							programs. The language was originally WordBasic, but changed to Visual Basic for Applications as 
							of Word 97.
						</p>
						<p>
							This extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate viruses in documents. The 
							tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, USB flash drives, and floppy 
							disks made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the Melissa virus, 
							but countless others have existed.
						</p>
						<p>
							These macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh 
							computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any macOS system up until the advent 
							of video codec trojans in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that 
							effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.
							Word's macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the 
							user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk 
							from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.
							Create or run a macro
							To save time on tasks you do often, bundle the steps into a macro. First, you record the macro. Then 
							you can run the macro by clicking a button on the Quick Access Toolbar or pressing a combination 
							of keys. It depends on how you set it up.

						<h3>Record a macro with a button</h3>
						<p>
							<ol>
								<li>Click <code><b>View</b></code> -> <code><b>Macros</b></code> -> <code><b>Record Macro</b></code>.</li>
								<li>Type a name for the macro.</li>
								<li>
									To use this macro in any new documents you make, be sure the Store macro in box says 
									<b>All Documents (Normal.dotm).</b>
								</li>
								<li>To run your macro when you click a button, click Button.</li>					
								<li>

									and click Add.
								</li>
								<li>Click <code>Modify</code>.</li>
								<li>Choose a button image, type the name you want, and click OK twice.</li>
								<li>
